== Boost Basic Linear Algebra


=== Release 1.70.0

==== improvements

* Add support for GPU-accelerated operations via
http://boostorg.github.io/compute/[Boost.Compute]
* Add support for a new (arbitrary-rank) tensor type and associated
operations.

=== Release 1.52.0

==== improvements

* https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/4024[[4024]] improve
performance of inplace_solve
* https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/6511[[6511]] Division by
scalar should use enable_if<>
* https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/7297[[7297]] Make the free
functions 'num_columns' and 'num_rows' support the uBLAS traits system
and better work with expression types

==== bug fixes

* https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/7296[[7296]] fixes and
improvements to test utility functions
* https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/7363[[7363]] fixed
coordinate_matrix::sort() for gcc 4.7 and others

=== Release 1.43.0

==== bug fixes

* https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/3968[[3968]] fixed
coordinate_matrix sort problem on MSVC10
* https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/3539[[3539]] changed
computation of `norm_inf` for complex types to match mathematical
definition. +
*Note:* This might cause a performance drop because now `std::abs(z)` is
called for each vector element. The old implementation used
`std::max(std::abs(real(z)),std::abs(imag(z))`. Further `norm_inf` and
`norm_1` will now return the same values for complex vector.
* https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/3501[[3501]] Moved free
functions in `concepts.hpp` into anonymous namespace.

=== Release 1.41.1

==== new features

* Move semantics of vector/matrix container assignments have been
implemented. They can be enabled by setting BOOST_UBLAS_MOVE_SEMANTICS.
More details are on the link:options.html[preprocessor options page].
* Introduce new free functions. See
https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/3449[[3449]], the new tests in
libs/numeric/ublas/test and the inline documentation of the files in
boost/numeric/ublas/operation/.

==== bug fixes

* https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/3293[[3293]] Fix resizing
problem in `identity_matrix`
* https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/3499[[3499]] Add
DefaultConstructible to concept checks
