==== Type requirements

None.

==== Public base classes

`ublas_expression<E>`.

==== Template parameters

[cols=",",]
|===
|Parameter |Description
|`T` |The type of the tensor.
|`E` |The type of the tensor expression.

===== Description

The templated class `binary_tensor_expression<T,EL,ER,OP>` contains a
constant reference to a left and right expression that can be evaluated
by using the access operator.
