== Overview


=== Rationale

It would be nice if every kind of numeric software could be written in
C++ without loss of efficiency, but unless something can be found that
achieves this without compromising the C++ type system it may be
preferable to rely on Fortran, assembler or architecture-specific
extensions (Bjarne Stroustrup).

This C++ library is directed towards scientific computing on the level
of basic linear algebra constructions with matrices and vectors and
their corresponding abstract operations. The primary design goals were:

* mathematical notation
* efficiency
* functionality
* compatibility

Another intention was to evaluate, if the abstraction penalty resulting
from the use of such matrix and vector classes is acceptable.

=== Resources

The development of this library was guided by a couple of similar
efforts:

* http://www.netlib.org/blas/index.html[BLAS] by Jack Dongarra et al.
* http://www.oonumerics.org/blitz/[Blitz++] by Todd Veldhuizen
* http://acts.nersc.gov/pooma/[POOMA] by Scott Haney et al.
* http://www.lsc.nd.edu/research/mtl/[MTL] by Jeremy Siek et al.

BLAS seems to be the most widely used library for basic linear algebra
constructions, so it could be called a de-facto standard. Its interface
is procedural, the individual functions are somewhat abstracted from
simple linear algebra operations. Due to the fact that is has been
implemented using Fortran and its optimizations, it also seems to be one
of the fastest libraries available. As we decided to design and
implement our library in an object-oriented way, the technical
approaches are distinct. However anyone should be able to express BLAS
abstractions in terms of our library operators and to compare the
efficiency of the implementations.

Blitz++ is an impressive library implemented in C++. Its main design
seems to be oriented towards multidimensional arrays and their
associated operators including tensors. The author of Blitz++ states,
that the library achieves performance on par or better than
corresponding Fortran code due to his implementation technique using
expression templates and template metaprograms. However we see some
reasons, to develop an own design and implementation approach. We do not
know whether anybody tries to implement traditional linear algebra and
other numerical algorithms using Blitz++. We also presume that even
today Blitz++ needs the most advanced C++ compiler technology due to its
implementation idioms. On the other hand, Blitz++ convinced us, that the
use of expression templates is mandatory to reduce the abstraction
penalty to an acceptable limit.

POOMA's design goals seem to parallel Blitz++'s in many parts . It
extends Blitz++'s concepts with classes from the domains of partial
differential equations and theoretical physics. The implementation
supports even parallel architectures.

MTL is another approach supporting basic linear algebra operations in
C++. Its design mainly seems to be influenced by BLAS and the C++
Standard Template Library. We share the insight that a linear algebra
library has to provide functionality comparable to BLAS. On the other
hand we think, that the concepts of the C++ standard library have not
yet been proven to support numerical computations as needed. As another
difference MTL currently does not seem to use expression templates. This
may result in one of two consequences: a possible loss of expressiveness
or a possible loss of performance.

=== Concepts

==== Mathematical Notation

The usage of mathematical notation may ease the development of
scientific algorithms. So a C++ library implementing basic linear
algebra concepts carefully should overload selected C++ operators on
matrix and vector classes.

We decided to use operator overloading for the following primitives:

[cols="<,<",]
|===
|Description |Operator

|Indexing of vectors and matrices
|`vector::operator(size_t i); matrix::operator(size_t i, size_t j);`

|Assignment of vectors and matrices
|`vector::operator = (const vector_expression &); vector::operator += (const vector_expression &); vector::operator -= (const vector_expression &); vector::operator *= (const scalar_expression &); matrix::operator = (const matrix_expression &); matrix::operator += (const matrix_expression &); matrix::operator -= (const matrix_expression &); matrix::operator *= (const scalar_expression &);`

|Unary operations on vectors and matrices
|`vector_expression operator - (const vector_expression &); matrix_expression operator - (const matrix_expression &);`

|Binary operations on vectors and matrices
|`vector_expression operator + (const vector_expression &, const vector_expression &); vector_expression operator - (const vector_expression &, const vector_expression &); matrix_expression operator + (const matrix_expression &, const matrix_expression &); matrix_expression operator - (const matrix_expression &, const matrix_expression &);`

|Multiplication of vectors and matrices with a scalar
|`vector_expression operator * (const scalar_expression &, const vector_expression &); vector_expression operator * (const vector_expression &, const scalar_expression &); matrix_expression operator * (const scalar_expression &, const matrix_expression &); matrix_expression operator * (const matrix_expression &, const scalar_expression &);`
|===

We decided to use no operator overloading for the following other
primitives:

[cols="<,<",]
|===
|Description |Function

|Left multiplication of vectors with a matrix
|`vector_expression prod<vector_type
> (const matrix_expression &, const vector_expression &); vector_expression prod (const matrix_expression &, const vector_expression &);`

|Right multiplication of vectors with a matrix
|`vector_expression prod<vector_type
> (const vector_expression &, const matrix_expression &); vector_expression prod (const vector_expression &, const matrix_expression &);`

|Multiplication of matrices |`matrix_expression prod<matrix_type
> (const matrix_expression &, const matrix_expression &); matrix_expression prod (const matrix_expression &, const matrix_expression &);`

|Inner product of vectors
|`scalar_expression inner_prod (const vector_expression &, const vector_expression &);`

|Outer product of vectors
|`matrix_expression outer_prod (const vector_expression &, const vector_expression &);`

|Transpose of a matrix
|`matrix_expression trans (const matrix_expression &);`
|===

==== Efficiency

To achieve the goal of efficiency for numerical computing, one has to
overcome two difficulties in formulating abstractions with C++, namely
temporaries and virtual function calls. Expression templates solve these
problems, but tend to slow down compilation times.

===== Eliminating Temporaries

Abstract formulas on vectors and matrices normally compose a couple of
unary and binary operations. The conventional way of evaluating such a
formula is first to evaluate every leaf operation of a composition into
a temporary and next to evaluate the composite resulting in another
temporary. This method is expensive in terms of time especially for
small and space especially for large vectors and matrices. The approach
to solve this problem is to use lazy evaluation as known from modern
functional programming languages. The principle of this approach is to
evaluate a complex expression element wise and to assign it directly to
the target.

Two interesting and dangerous facts result:

===== Aliases

One may get serious side effects using element wise evaluation on
vectors or matrices. Consider the matrix vector product _x = A x_.
Evaluation of __A__~_1_~_x_ and assignment to __x__~_1_~ changes the
right hand side, so that the evaluation of __A__~_2_~_x_ returns a wrong
result. In this case there are *aliases* of the elements __x__~_n_~ on
both the left and right hand side of the assignment.

Our solution for this problem is to evaluate the right hand side of an
assignment into a temporary and then to assign this temporary to the
left hand side. To allow further optimizations, we provide a
corresponding member function for every assignment operator and also a
link:operations_overview.html#noalias[`noalias` syntax.] By using this
syntax a programmer can confirm, that the left and right hand sides of
an assignment are independent, so that element wise evaluation and
direct assignment to the target is safe.

===== Complexity

The computational complexity may be unexpectedly large under certain
cirumstances. Consider the chained matrix vector product _A (B x)_.
Conventional evaluation of _A (B x)_ is quadratic. Deferred evaluation
of __B x__~_i_~ is linear. As every element __B x__~_i_~ is needed
linearly depending of the size, a completely deferred evaluation of the
chained matrix vector product _A (B x)_ is cubic. In such cases one
needs to reintroduce temporaries in the expression.

===== Eliminating Virtual Function Calls

Lazy expression evaluation normally leads to the definition of a class
hierarchy of terms. This results in the usage of dynamic polymorphism to
access single elements of vectors and matrices, which is also known to
be expensive in terms of time. A solution was found a couple of years
ago independently by David Vandervoorde and Todd Veldhuizen and is
commonly called expression templates. Expression templates contain lazy
evaluation and replace dynamic polymorphism with static, i.e. compile
time polymorphism. Expression templates heavily depend on the famous
Barton-Nackman trick, also coined 'curiously defined recursive
templates' by Jim Coplien.

Expression templates form the base of our implementation.

===== Compilation times

It is also a well known fact, that expression templates challenge
currently available compilers. We were able to significantly reduce the
amount of needed expression templates using the Barton-Nackman trick
consequently.

We also decided to support a dual conventional implementation (i.e. not
using expression templates) with extensive bounds and type checking of
vector and matrix operations to support the development cycle. Switching
from debug mode to release mode is controlled by the `NDEBUG`
preprocessor symbol of `<cassert>`.

Functionality

Every C++ library supporting linear algebra will be measured against the
long-standing Fortran package BLAS. We now describe how BLAS calls may
be mapped onto our classes.

The page link:operations_overview.html[Overview of Matrix and Vector
Operations] gives a short summary of the most used operations on vectors
and matrices.

=== Storage Layout

uBLAS supports many different storage layouts. The full details can be
found at the link:types_overview.html[Overview of Types]. Most types
like `vector<double>` and `matrix<double>` are by default compatible to
C arrays, but can also be configured to contain FORTAN compatible data.

=== Compatibility

For compatibility reasons we provide array like indexing for vectors and
matrices. For some types (hermitian, sparse etc) this can be expensive
for matrices due to the needed temporary proxy objects.

uBLAS uses STL compatible allocators for the allocation of the storage
required for it's containers.

=== Benchmark Results

The following tables contain results of one of our benchmarks. This
benchmark compares a native C implementation ('C array') and some
library based implementations. The safe variants based on the library
assume aliasing, the fast variants do not use temporaries and are
functionally equivalent to the native C implementation. Besides the
generic vector and matrix classes the benchmark utilizes special classes
`c_vector` and `c_matrix`, which are intended to avoid every overhead
through genericity.

The benchmark program *bench1* was compiled with GCC 4.0 and run on an
Athlon 64 3000+. Times are scales for reasonable precision by running
*bench1 100*.

First we comment the results for double vectors and matrices of
dimension 3 and 3 x 3, respectively.

We notice a two fold performance loss for small vectors and matrices:
first the general abstraction penalty for using classes, and then a
small loss when using the generic vector and matrix classes. The
difference w.r.t. alias assumptions is also significant.

Next we comment the results for double vectors and matrices of dimension
100 and 100 x 100, respectively.

For larger vectors and matrices the general abstraction penalty for
using classes seems to decrease, the small loss when using generic
vector and matrix classes seems to remain. The difference w.r.t. alias
assumptions remains visible, too.
