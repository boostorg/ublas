|Name |Expression |Type requirements |Return type

|Sizing constructor |`V v (n)` |  |`V`

|Insert |`v.insert_element (i, t)` |`v` is mutable. |`void`

|Erase |`v.erase_element (i)` |`v` is mutable. |`void`

|Clear |`v.clear ()` |`v` is mutable. |`void`

==== Expression semantics

Semantics of an expression is defined only where it differs from, or is
not defined in link:expression_concept.adoc#vector_expression[Vector
Expression] .

[width="100%",cols=",,,,",options="header",]
|===
|Name |Expression |Precondition |Semantics |Postcondition
|Sizing constructor |`V v (n)` |`n >= 0` |Allocates a vector of `n`
elements. |`v.size () == n`.

|Element access link:#element_access_note[[2]] |`v[n]` |`0<n>v.size()`
|returns the n-th element in v | 

|Insert |`v.insert_element (i, t)` |`0 < = i < v.size ()`. |Inserts an
element at `v (i)` with value `t`. The storage requirement of the Vector
may be increased. |`v (i)` is equal to `t`.

|Erase |`v.erase_element (i)` |`0 < = i < v.size ()` |Destroys the
element as `v (i)` and replaces it with the default `value_type ()`. The
storage requirement of the Vector may be decreased. |`v (i)` is equal to
`value_type ()`.

|Clear |`v.clear ()` |  |Equivalent to +
`for (i = 0; i < v.size (); ++ i)` +
  `v.erase_element (i);` | 

|Resize |`v.resize (n) v.resize (n, p)` |  |Reallocates the vector so
that it can hold `n` elements. +
Erases or appends elements in order to bring the vector to the
prescribed size. Appended elements copies of `value_type()`. +
When `p == false` then existing elements are not preserved and elements
will not appended as normal. Instead the vector is in the same state as
that after an equivalent sizing constructor. |`v.size () == n`.

|Storage |`v.data()` | |Returns a reference to the underlying dense
storage. | 
|===

==== Complexity guarantees

The run-time complexity of the sizing constructor is linear in the
vector's size.

The run-time complexity of insert_element and erase_element is specific
for the Vector model and it depends on increases/decreases in storage
requirements.

The run-time complexity of resize is linear in the vector's size.

==== Notes

[#vector_expression_note]#[1]# As a user you need not care about Vector
being a refinement of the VectorExpression. Being a refinement of the
VectorExpression is only important for the template-expression engine
but not the user.

[#element_access_note]#[2]# The `operator[]` is added purely for
convenience and compatibility with the `std::vector`. In uBLAS however,
generally `operator()` is used for indexing because this can be used for
both vectors and matrices.
