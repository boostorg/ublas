== Boost Basic Linear Algebra - Configuration Options


=== NDEBUG

*Make sure you define NDEBUG* The only way uBLAS knows you want a
release configuration is to check if you have defined NDEBUG. If you
don't it assumes you want a debug configuration and adds a lot of very
useful runtime check. However these are very slow!

=== BOOST_UBLAS_MOVE_SEMANTICS

The patch and description was provided by Nasos Iliopoulos.

An immediate effect of this option is the elimination of the need for
noalias in types vector<T> and matrix<T>, when assigned to the same
type. This option doesn't have an effect on bounded and c types.
Although it is rare, not all compilers support copy elision (that allows
for move semantics), so a test must be performed to make sure that there
is a benefit when it is enabled. A small demonstration and test can be
found in
link:../test/manual/test_move_semantics.cpp[test_move_semantics.cpp]

In the link:../test/manual/test_move_semantics.cpp[test example] two
tests are defined, one for vectors and one for matrices. The aim of this
example is to print the pointers of the storage of each of the
containers, before and after the assignment to a temporary object. When
move semantics are enabled, the vector<T> and matrix<T> storage is moved
from the temporary and no copy is performed.

If move semantics are supported by your compiler you will get an output
like the following:

[source,screen]
----
matrix<double> --------------------------------------------------------------------
Temporary pointer r: 0x94790c0
Pointer (must be equal to temp. pointer if move semantics are enabled) : 0x94790c0
----

Notes:

* It should be no surprise to see matrices and vectors been passed by
VALUE, the compiler takes care and either moves (if the underlying code
does not modify the object), or copies (if the underlying code modifies
the object).
* There might be some space for some improvements (like clearing the
data, before swaping)
* Move semantics don't eliminate temporaries. They rather move their
storage around so no copies are performed.
* MSVC does no implement Named Return Value Optimization in debug mode.
So if you build in debug with this compiler you might get
https://connect.microsoft.com/VisualStudio/feedback/ViewFeedback.aspx?FeedbackID=483229[different
behaviour] than a release build.
* Enabling move semantics is done via #define
BOOST_UBLAS_MOVE_SEMANTICS.
* There is plenty of room for optimizations when c++0x standard is out,
taking advantage of rvalue references. (I have a sweet vector
implementation using that).
* If you enable move semantics and your compiler does not support them,
the operation will just be as passing by const reference.

=== BOOST_UBLAS_CHECK_ENABLE

When BOOST_UBLAS_CHECK_ENABLE is defined then all index and parameter
checks are enabled. This is enabled in debug mode and disabled in
release mode.

=== BOOST_UBLAS_TYPE_CHECK

When BOOST_UBLAS_TYPE_CHECK is enabled then all possibly expensive
structure checks are enabled. If this is not desireable then use #define
BOOST_UBLAS_TYPE_CHECK 0 before including any uBLAS header. The define
BOOST_UBLAS_TYPE_CHECK_EPSILON can be used to control the acceptable
tolerance, see detail/matrix_assign.hpp for implementation details of
this check.

=== BOOST_UBLAS_USE_LONG_DOUBLE

Enable uBLAS expressions that involve containers of 'long double'

=== BOOST_UBLAS_USE_INTERVAL

Enable uBLAS expressions that involve containers of
'boost::numeric::interval' types

=== Configuring uBLAS with Macros

Many macro's appear in ublas/config.hpp and elsewhere. Hopefully in the
future some of these will disappear! They fall into 4 groups:

* Automatically set by 'boost/numeric/ublas/config.hpp' based on NDEBUG.
Makes the distinction between debug (safe) and release (fast) mode.
Similar to STLport
** _Release_ mode (NDEBUG defined)
*** BOOST_UBLAS_INLINE _Compiler dependant definition to control
function inlining._
*** BOOST_UBLAS_USE_FAST_SAME
** _Debug_ mode
*** BOOST_UBLAS_CHECK_ENABLE _Enable checking of indexs, iterators and
parameters. Prevents out of bound access etc._
*** BOOST_UBLAS_TYPE_CHECK _Enable additional checks for the results of
expressions using non dense types. Picks up runtime error such as the
assignment of a numerically non-symmetric matrix to symmertic_matrix.
Use #define BOOST_UBLAS_TYPE_CHECK 0 to disable expensive numeric type
checks._ (Note: "structure check" would be a much better name.)
*** BOOST_UBLAS_TYPE_CHECK_EPSILON _default: sqrt(epsilon), controls how
large the difference between the expected result and the computed result
may become. Increase this value if you are going to use near singular or
badly scaled matrices. Please, refer to detail/matrix_assign.hpp for
implementation of these type checks._
* Automatically set by 'boost/numeric/ublas/config.hpp' based on
compiler and boost/config.hpp macro's. Augments the compiler deficiency
workarounds already supplied by boost/config.hpp
** BOOST_UBLAS_NO_NESTED_CLASS_RELATION _A particularly nasty problem
with VC7.1 Requires that uBLAS and the user use begin(it) rather then
it.begin()_
** BOOST_UBLAS_NO_SMART_PROXIES _Disable the automatic propagation of
'constantness' to proxies. Smart proxies automatically determine if the
underling container they reference is constant or not. They adjust there
definition of iterators and container access to reflect this
constantness._
* For use by uBLAS authors to test implementation methods. Preset in
config.hpp
** BOOST_UBLAS_USE_INVARIANT_HOISTING
** BOOST_UBLAS_USE_INDEXING
** BOOST_UBLAS_USE_INDEXED_ITERATOR
** BOOST_UBLAS_NON_CONFORMANT_PROXIES _Gappy containers may be
non-conformant, that is contain elements at different indices. Assigning
between proxies (vector ranges for example) of these containers is
difficult as the LHS may need insert new elements. This is slow._
** BOOST_UBLAS_USE_DUFF_DEVICE _Near useless on all platforms (see GCC's
-funroll-loops)_
* User options. Can be predefined by user before including any uBLAS
headers. They may also be automatically defined for some compilers to
work around compile bugs.
** BOOST_UBLAS_USE_LONG_DOUBLE _Enable uBLAS expressions that involve
containers of 'long double'_
** BOOST_UBLAS_USE_INTERVAL _Enable uBLAS expressions that involve
containers of 'boost::numeric::interval' types_
** BOOST_UBLAS_SIMPLE_ET_DEBUG _In order to simplify debugging is is
possible to simplify expression templateso they are restricted to a
single operation_
** BOOST_UBLAS_ENABLE_PROXY_SHORTCUTS _enable automatic conversion from
proxy class to matrix expression_
** BOOST_UBLAS_NO_ELEMENT_PROXIES _Disables the use of element proxies
for gappy types._
** _The Gappy types (sparse, coordinate, compressed) store non-zero
elements in their own containers. When new non-zero elements are
assigned they must rearrange these containers. This invalidates
references, iterators or pointers to these elements. This can happen at
some surprising times such as the expression "a [1] = a [0] = 1;".
Element proxies guarantee all such expressions will work as expected.
However they bring their own restrictions and efficiency problems. For
example as of Boost 1.30.0 they prevent the assignment of elements
between different types._
** BOOST_UBLAS_REFERENCE_CONST_MEMBER _Enable to allow refernces to be
returned to fixed (zero or one) elements of triangular or banded
matrices_
** BOOST_UBLAS_NO_EXCEPTIONS _Disable the use exceptions of uBLAS
internal checks and error conditions. BOOST_NO_EXCEPTIONS has same
effect._
** BOOST_UBLAS_SINGULAR_CHECK _Check the for singularity in triangular
solve() functions_
